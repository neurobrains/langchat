config = LangChatConfig(
    openai_api_keys=["sk-..."],

## Travel Assistant Chat

import asyncio
from langchat import LangChat

async def travel_chat():
    langchat = LangChat(config=config)
    
    queries = [
        "What are the best travel destinations in Europe?",
        "What about budget-friendly options?",
        "Which one has the best beaches?"
    ]
    
    for query in queries:
        result = await langchat.chat(
            query=query,
            user_id="traveler123",
            domain="travel"
        )
        print(f"User: {query}")
        print(f"AI: {result['response']}\n")

asyncio.run(travel_chat())
```
