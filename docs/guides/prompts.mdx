import { Callout } from 'mintlify';

## Understanding Prompts

LangChat uses two types of prompts:

1. **System Prompt** - Defines the chatbot's personality and behavior
2. **Standalone Question Prompt** - Converts user questions into search queries

## System Prompt

The system prompt is the main instruction that defines your chatbot's role, behavior, and how it should respond.

### Default System Prompt

If you don't provide a custom prompt, LangChat uses a default:

```python
"""You are a helpful assistant specializing in {domain}.

Use the following context to answer questions:
{context}

Chat history: {chat_history}

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
```

### Custom System Prompt

```python
from langchat import LangChatConfig

config = LangChatConfig(
    # ... other config ...
    
    system_prompt_template="""You are a friendly travel assistant.
    
    Your expertise includes:
    - Destination recommendations
    - Flight and hotel booking
    - Local attractions and activities
    - Travel tips and safety information
    
    Use the following context to answer questions:
    {context}
    
    Previous conversation:
    {chat_history}
    
    User's question: {question}
    
    Provide a helpful and friendly response:"""
)
```

### Prompt Variables

Your system prompt template can use these variables:

- `{domain}` - The user's domain (e.g., "education", "travel")
- `{context}` - Retrieved context from vector search
- `{chat_history}` - Previous conversation history
- `{question}` - Current user question

<Callout type="info">
All variables are automatically filled by LangChat when processing queries.
</Callout>

## Standalone Question Prompt

The standalone question prompt converts conversational questions into searchable queries.

### Default Standalone Question Prompt

```python
"""Convert this question to a standalone search query.

Chat History: {chat_history}
Question: {question}
Standalone query:"""
```

### Custom Standalone Question Prompt

```python
config = LangChatConfig(
    # ... other config ...
    
    standalone_question_prompt="""Convert this travel-related question to a standalone search query.
    Make sure the query captures the intent for finding relevant travel information.
    
    Chat History: {chat_history}
    Question: {question}
    Standalone query:"""
)
```

## Prompt Examples

```python
EDUCATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert education consultant specializing in study abroad programs.

Your expertise includes:
- University and program recommendations
- Admission requirements and procedures

Provide a helpful response that guides them toward suitable options:"""

config = LangChatConfig(
    # ... other config ...
    system_prompt_template=EDUCATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT
)
```

### Travel Assistant

```python
TRAVEL_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful travel assistant specializing in trip planning, recommendations, and travel information.

Your expertise includes:
- Destination recommendations based on budget and preferences
- Flight and hotel booking guidance
- Local attractions and activities
- Travel tips and safety information
- Cultural insights and local customs

Be friendly, concise, and helpful. Provide practical, actionable advice.

Use the following context to answer questions:
{context}

Question: {question}
Answer:"""

TRAVEL_STANDALONE_PROMPT = """Convert this travel-related question to a standalone search query.
Make sure the query captures the intent for finding relevant travel information.

Chat History: {chat_history}
Question: {question}
Standalone query:"""

config = LangChatConfig(
    # ... other config ...
    system_prompt_template=TRAVEL_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    standalone_question_prompt=TRAVEL_STANDALONE_PROMPT
)
```

### Customer Support

```python
SUPPORT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a customer support agent for TechCorp products.

Your responsibilities:
- Answer product questions accurately
- Help troubleshoot technical issues
- Guide users through features
- Escalate complex issues when needed

Communication Guidelines:
- Be professional and empathetic
- Acknowledge user concerns
- Provide step-by-step solutions
- Ask clarifying questions when needed

Product Context:
{context}

Previous conversation:
{chat_history}

Customer inquiry: {question}

Provide a helpful response:"""

config = LangChatConfig(
    # ... other config ...
    system_prompt_template=SUPPORT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific About the Role

Clearly define your chatbot's role:

```python
# ❌ Vague
"""You are an assistant. Help users."""

# ✅ Specific
"""You are an expert education consultant specializing in study abroad programs.
Your goal is to help students find the best universities based on their academic profiles."""
```

### 2. Include Context Instructions

Tell the model how to use retrieved context:

```python
"""Use the following context to answer questions:
{context}

If the context doesn't contain relevant information, say so honestly."""
```

### 3. Guide Conversation Style

Specify how the chatbot should communicate:

```python
"""Communication Style:
- Friendly and professional
- Concise and actionable
- Use emojis appropriately
- Break down complex information"""
```

### 4. Handle Edge Cases

Provide instructions for common scenarios:

```python
"""If the user asks about something not in the context:
1. Acknowledge the limitation
2. Offer alternative assistance
3. Suggest contacting support if needed"""
```

### 5. Use Domain-Specific Language

Tailor language to your domain:

```python
# Education domain
"""Use terms like: 'academic profile', 'CGPA', 'admission requirements', 'intake session'"""

# Travel domain
"""Use terms like: 'destination', 'itinerary', 'travel dates', 'budget-friendly'"""
```

## Dynamic Prompts

You can also create dynamic prompts programmatically:

```python
def create_custom_prompt(domain: str, style: str = "professional") -> str:
    base_prompt = f"""You are a {domain} assistant."""
    
    if style == "friendly":
        base_prompt += "\n\nCommunication Style: Friendly, use emojis, keep it casual."
    elif style == "professional":
        base_prompt += "\n\nCommunication Style: Professional, formal, detailed."
    
    base_prompt += """
    
    Use the following context:
    {context}
    
    Chat history: {chat_history}
    Question: {question}
    Answer:"""
    
    return base_prompt

config = LangChatConfig(
    # ... other config ...
    system_prompt_template=create_custom_prompt("education", "friendly")
)
```

## Testing Prompts

Test your prompts with different scenarios:

```python
async def test_prompt():
    langchat = LangChat(config=config)
    
    test_cases = [
        "What universities are good for computer science?",
        "I need help with my visa application",
        "What's the deadline for fall intake?"
    ]
    
    for query in test_cases:
        result = await langchat.chat(
            query=query,
            user_id="test_user",
            domain="education"
        )
        print(f"Q: {query}")
        print(f"A: {result['response']}\n")
```

## Prompt Optimization Tips

### 1. Iterate and Test

Start with a simple prompt and refine based on results:

```python
# Version 1: Basic
"""You are a helpful assistant. Answer questions using {context}."""

# Version 2: More specific
"""You are an education consultant. Help students find universities using {context}."""

# Version 3: Detailed
"""You are an expert education consultant specializing in study abroad programs.
[Detailed instructions...]"""
```

### 2. Monitor Response Quality

Check if responses:
- Use the retrieved context appropriately
- Match your desired tone and style
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### 3. Adjust for Your Domain

Different domains need different approaches:

- **Education**: Detailed, structured, professional
- **Travel**: Friendly, concise, visual
- **Support**: Empathetic, solution-focused
